# Advent-of-Code-2020

These are my attemps at solving AoC puzzles in Python. No optimisation, only a first try as quickly as possible to arrive at good answer.

Format is:
 - `p<day>.py` - code
 - `p<day>.txt` - input data


Timings on my MacBook Pro 13 2020 (note that Python interpreter alone needs ~0.140s to start)

```
prog     time
p01.py    0.625s
